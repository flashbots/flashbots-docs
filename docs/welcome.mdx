# Welcome to Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains, starting with Ethereum.

## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem for MEV, via a three-pronged approach:

- **Illuminate**: bringing transparency to MEV activity, quantifying its impact, and reducing information asymmetry between participants.
- **Democratize**: democratizing access to MEV via open platforms that maximize competition and are freely available to all.
- **Distribute**: enabling sustainable distribution of any remaining MEV.

Product & research are the semi-autonomous dual engines that propel our organization forward:

- [Flashbots Product](/) builds core infrastructure and ecosystem tooling that redefine the block production supply chain across blockchains and protect users.
- [Flashbots Research](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research) explores MEV market dynamics and blockchain design challenges at the intersection of economics, security, and cryptography.

You can interact with Flashbots via our [Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/) where we have dedicated categories for each of our efforts and welcome your contributions. Our work is open source and you can follow our progress under each [Github](https://github.com/flashbots/pm) repository of the Flashbots organization.
