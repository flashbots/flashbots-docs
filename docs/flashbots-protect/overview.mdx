Flashbots Protect makes it easy for anyone to protect themselves against frontrunning and sandwich attacks by routing transactions to the Flashbots Matchmaker, instead of the public mempool. The experience for the end user is the same as before, just with added benefits.

The major benefits of connecting to Flashbots Protect are:

- **Frontrunning protection:** transactions will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.
- **No failed transactions:** transactions will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts, so users don't pay for failed transactions.
- **Etherscan integration:** users can see the status of their transactions on Etherscan.
- **Get MEV back**: if your transaction creates MEV, you get up to 90% of it back through [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/overview).

Privacy notice: **Flashbots Protect does not track** any kind of user information (i.e. IP, location, etc.). No user information is ever stored or even logged.

We intend to release more features on top of Flashbots Protect as part of MEV-Share, offering even more powerful functionalities.

We want to thank MiningDAO, mistX and Nethermind for significant code contributions, testing, and being early adopters of Flashbots Protect.
