Flashbots Protect is a cheaper and safer way to transact on Ethereum. It protects your transactions from frontrunning and gives you refunds on gas fees and MEV.

Key benefits:
- **Frontrunning protection:** Transactions are sent to a private Flashbots mempool where they will be hidden from frontrunning and sandwich bots.
- **Refunds**: If your transaction creates MEV, you can earn an [MEV refund](/flashbots-protect/mev-refunds). If your transaction pays high priority fees, you can earn [gas fee refunds](/flashbots-protect/gas-fee-refunds).
- **No failed transactions:** Transactions are only included in the block if they do not revert. Users do not pay fees for failed transactions.
- **Configurable:** You can customize your privacy, speed, and refund settings.

Use Flashbots Protect by clicking the button below or by sending `eth_sendRawTransaction` API requests to `rpc.flashbots.net/fast`.
