## Key Considerations

Flashbots Protect has the following key benefits:

- **Highly Configurable:** Customize your preference level for privacy, latency, and rebate returns.
- **No frontrunning:** Transactions are hidden from the public mempool away from front-running and sandwich bots.
- **Earn MEV refunds**: If your transaction creates MEV, receive up to 90% of realized MEV back through [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/introduction).
- **No failed transactions:** Transactions are only included in the block if they will not revert. Users do not pay fees for failed transactions.

### Faster Transactions

Using Protect in fast mode accelerates the inclusion of your transaction. Click the "fast" option when [configuring your Protect RPC](/flashbots-protect/quick-start#using-flashbots-protect) or manually set your RPC to `rpc.flashbots.net/fast`.

Fast mode details:

1. **Shared with all builders:** Transactions are multiplexed, or shared, with all [registered builders](https://github.com/flashbots/dowg/blob/main/builder-registrations.json) within one block after they are received.  Multiplexing increases the probability that the transaction will be sent to the builder building the winning block.
2. **Larger validator payment:** With the default RPC, 10% of the MEV-Share refund is paid to validators. In fast mode, validators receive a higher percentage of the MEV-Share refund increasing the probability that the transaction will be included in the winning block. 

**Note**: When you send your transaction to a builder, you trust them not to frontrun your transaction or disclose it to third-party MEV searchers.

:::warning Do Not Switch RPCs Before Transaction Confirmation
If you submit a transaction through Flashbots Protect via the MetaMask wallet, do not switch RPCs before transaction confirmation.  MetaMask may resend the transaction to the public mempool exposing your transaction to potential MEV attacks if RPCs are switched before transaction confirmation.
