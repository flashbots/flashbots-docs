### Key Considerations

Flashbots Protect has the following key benefits:

- **Frontrunning protection:** Transactions are hidden from the public mempool away from front-running and sandwich bots.
- **Refunds**: If your transaction creates MEV, you can earn an [MEV refund](/flashbots-protect/mev-refunds). If your transaction pays high priority fees, you can earn [gas fee refunds](/flashbots-protect/gas-fee-refunds).
- **No failed transactions:** Transactions are only included in the block if they do not revert. Users do not pay fees for failed transactions.
- **Configurable:** You can customize your privacy, speed, and refund settings.

### Faster Transactions

Use Protect in fast mode to land your transactions faster on chain. Click the "fast" option when [configuring your Protect RPC](/flashbots-protect/quick-start#using-flashbots-protect) or manually set your RPC to `rpc.flashbots.net/fast`.

Fast mode details:

1. **Shared with TEE searchers:** Transactions are shared with non-TEE and TEE searchers, leading to better MEV refunds than the default RPC without exposing the user to any additional frontrunning or sandwich attack risk. 
2. **Shared with all builders:** Transactions are multiplexed, or shared, with all [registered builders](https://github.com/flashbots/dowg/blob/main/builder-registrations.json) within one block after they are received. Multiplexing increases the probability that the transaction will be sent to the builder building the winning block.
3. **Larger validator payment:** With the default RPC, 10% of the MEV-Share refund is paid to validators. In fast mode, validators receive a higher percentage of the MEV-Share refund increasing the probability that the transaction will be included in the winning block.

**Note**: When you send your transaction to a builder, you trust them not to frontrun your transaction or disclose it to third-party MEV searchers. 

### Customer Support

Wallets and applications can receive customer support for transactions tagged with their `originId`. To opt into customer support, update your RPC URL to `rpc.flashbots.net/fast?originId=[your-wallet-name]`.

:::warning Do Not Switch RPCs Before Transaction Confirmation

If you submit a transaction through Flashbots Protect via the MetaMask wallet, do not switch RPCs before transaction confirmation. MetaMask may resend the transaction to the public mempool exposing your transaction to potential MEV attacks if RPCs are switched before transaction confirmation.

### 0 Priority Fees

Flashbots Protect does not accept transactions with a priority fee of 0. They will be dropped and a standard error message will be returned.

## Using Flashbots Protect

There are three ways to use Flashbots Protect:

1. Add the Flashbots Protect RPC to your wallet.
2. Send transactions to the RPC URL using [eth_sendRawTransaction](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-sendrawtransaction).
3. Send transactions to Flashbots using [eth_sendPrivateTransaction](/flashbots-protect/additional-documentation/eth-sendPrivateTransaction).

The easiest way to use Flashbots Protect is to add the Flashbots Protect RPC to your wallet. Use the button below to create a custom Protect RPC or follow the manual instructions. **Note that you can configure the builders you send to and your MEV-Share hints as well**.
