Today, orderflow originators like wallets and dapps do not actively participate in MEV. Their users generate MEV when transacting, but this value is captured by builders, searchers, and validators -- not users, wallets, or dapps.

[MEV-share](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mev-share-programmably-private-orderflow-to-share-mev-with-users/1264) is a protocol that enables users, wallets, and dapps to **capture the MEV their transactions create.**

## Introduction

### What is MEV-share?

<WhatsMevShareAdvanced />

To start earning MEV kickbacks from MEV-share, submit your transactions to the Flashbots **Matchmaker**, either by [connecting your wallet to the Protect RPC](#connect-your-wallet), or sending a [private transaction](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendprivatetransaction) to the Matchmaker API.

### What is a matchmaker?

A matchmaker is a service that matches user transactions with searcher bundles. Flashbots runs a matchmaker on Ethereum mainnet. Users submit their transactions to the matchmaker, which shares select information about them with searchers. Searchers propose transactions for the matchmaker to bundle with the user transactions. Currently we only support backruns. The matchmaker forwards these bundles to a block builder with a requirement that **the user is paid a kickback** percent of the winning searcher's backrun profit.

## Connect Your Wallet

Ethereum users can start earning MEV kickbacks today by connecting their wallets to Flashbots Protect.

> :information_source: By default, users will connect to the [Stable](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration, which is tuned by Flashbots to optimize execution speed while protecting users from harmful MEV. This configuration can be modified to include more data. See the [Flashbots Protect MEV-Share](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share) docs to learn more.

## Technical Information

**Searchers** should check out the [Getting Started](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/getting-started) guide for a walkthrough of MEV-Share and how it differs from searching on the mempool.

**Wallet/Dapp Developers** should check out the [Integration Guide](/flashbots-mev-share/orderflow-providers/integration-guide) for information about MEV-Share and instructions on how to integrate your wallet.

### Sending Transactions

Wallet users connected to Flashbots Protect do not have to do anything to benefit from MEV-Share. Transactions received by the Protect RPC are automatically forwarded to MEV-Share with the default hint parameters.

To send transactions directly to Flashbots Matchmaker, use a [client library](https://github.com/flashbots/matchmaker-ts) or send a request to the [`sendPrivateTransaction`](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendprivatetransaction) endpoint with the `privacy` parameter.

### Listening for Transactions

MEV-Share dispatches data about pending transactions via an SSE event stream. To learn more, see the [MEV-Share Event Stream Docs](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream).

### Sending Bundles

Bundles on MEV-Share consist of signed transactions and transaction hashes from the event stream, as well as some metadata about the bundle's validity conditions.

To send a bundle to MEV-Share, use a [client library](https://github.com/flashbots/matchmaker-ts) or send a request to the [`mev_sendBundle`](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#mev_sendbundle) RPC endpoint. For more information about sending bundles, see [Sending Bundles](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/sending-bundles).
