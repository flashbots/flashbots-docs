Configure the percent(s) and recipient(s) for MEV-Share refunds by adding the [`refund`](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#refunds) query parameter to Protect RPC requests
or by adding `preferences.validity.refund` argument to the `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` JSON-RPC [method](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendprivatetransaction).

### eth_sendPrivateRawTransaction

- [eth_sendPrivateRawTransaction](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendprivaterawtransaction)
is now supported on relay endpoint. Its behavior is identical to `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` but its format is similar to `eth_sendRawTransaction`.
