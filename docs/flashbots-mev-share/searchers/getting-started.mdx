To start searching on MEV-Share, you will first need to connect to a MEV-Share Node. As a reminder, the MEV-Share Node is responsible for receiving transactions and bundles from users, and selectively sharing information ("hints") about them with searchers. When a searcher wants to include a transaction in their bundle, they use that transaction's hash. The MEV-Share Node replaces it with the original transaction before sending the bundle to a block builder.

## Connect to MEV-Share Node

Flashbots operates an MEV-Share Node on the Ethereum mainnet. This Node provides endpoints for user transactions and searcher bundles. Additionally, it offers an Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming endpoint, broadcasting pending events/transactions to searchers.

The simplest way to connect to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node is to use a [client library](/flashbots-auction/libraries/mev-share-clients). For this guide, we'll refer to [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts).

_Add library to your project:_

```bash
yarn add @flashbots/mev-share-client
```

_Use the following code to import the library_ (Replace ALL_CAPS placeholders with your data):

```typescript
import {Wallet, JsonRpcProvider} from 'ethers';
import MevShareClient, {
  BundleParams,
  IPendingBundle,
  IPendingTransaction,
  TransactionOptions,
} from '@flashbots/mev-share-client';

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
const authSigner = new Wallet(FB_REPUTATION_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner);
```

_Connecting to Goerli:_

```typescript
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumGoerli(authSigner);
```

To use custom network parameters, you can instantiate a new MevShareClient instance directly. This example is what the client uses to connect to mainnet:

```typescript
// connect to MEV-Share on mainnet
const mevShareClient = new MevShareClient(authSigner, {
  name: 'mainnet',
  chainId: 1,
  streamUrl: 'https://mev-share.flashbots.net',
  apiUrl: 'https://relay.flashbots.net',
});
```

Further documentation on the client library can be found in the [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts).

For Rust users, thanks to Paradigm's effort, we have a Rust MEV-Share client [mev-share-rs](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/mev-share-rs).

If you want a complete MEV bot framework, could also directly go for [Artemis](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/artemis), which has built-in support for MEV-Share as outlined in this [example](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/artemis/blob/main/examples/mev-share-arb/src/main.rs).

### A note on other languages

If you're coding in a language that doesn't yet have a MEV-Share Node client library, you can send transactions and bundles directly with the [JSON-RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint). To listen for transactions, all you need is an HTTP client. More details on that in the [Event Stream](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) page.

Now you should be connected to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node. Continue reading on the next page to learn how to [listen for hints](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) about pending transactions shared by the MEV-Share Node.

:::note A note for experienced searchers getting acquainted with MEV-Share

Searching on MEV-Share is different from searching on the mempool in that only certain parts of a transaction are shared with searchers. In the mempool, we can see all parts of a transaction, such as its calldata or who the transaction is from. But on MEV-Share, a transaction might only reveal its function selector, making a traditional arbitrage calculation infeasible.

There are three primary strategies for searching on MEV-Share:

- Probabilistically: send many bundles that probabilistically backrun MEV-Share orderflow.
- On-chain: perform more of your searching on-chain instead of off-chain.
- Existing: only search on transactions which share all the information you need.

To maximally leverage MEV-Share searchers will need to employ new strategies.
