title: Sending Bundles

While the new [bundle spec](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles#bundle-definition) may look complex, a bundle can be sent with default parameters using a client library, which ends up looking quite similar to sending bundles on mev-boost.

## Sending a Bundle

:::info Placeholders

Variables in `ALL_CAPS` are placeholders. To use this code, replace them with your own data.

<TabItem value="ts" label="matchmaker-ts">

```typescript
import Matchmaker, { BundleParams } from '@flashbots/matchmaker-ts'

const matchmaker = Matchmaker.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)

// ...

const bundle = [
    {hash: PENDING_TX_HASH},
    {tx: await wallet.signTransaction(BACKRUN_TX), canRevert: false},
]

const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: targetBlock,
        // target several blocks with `maxBlock`
        maxBlock: targetBlock + 3,
    },
    body: bundle,
}

const bundleResult = await matchmaker.sendBundle(params)
```

The first transaction in the bundle contains the hash of a pending transaction, which we presumably got from listening to the [event stream](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream). The second transaction is one we sign ourself, which backruns the first transaction, presumably for a profit.

See [matchmaker-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/matchmaker-ts/blob/main/src/examples/sendBackrunBundle.ts) for a full working example.

The params not included in the previous example can be used to configure more advanced conditions for your bundle's execution and the MEV kickbacks you earn.

### Share bundle data

Specify data about your bundle's transactions that you wish to share with other searchers. Doing this can earn you MEV kickbacks and improve your bundle's chances of inclusion.

```typescript
const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: TARGET_BLOCK,
    },
    body: BUNDLE,
    privacy: {
        hints: ["calldata", "logs"],
    },
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Nest bundles (be a matchmaker)

Matchmakers nest bundles to build composite bundles that are more profitable.

```typescript
const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: TARGET_BLOCK,
    },
    body: {
        {hash: PENDING_TX_HASH},
        {bundle: {
            inclusion: {...},
            body: {...},
            privacy: {...},
            validity: {...},
        }}
    },
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### targetBuilder Inheritance

<TargetBuilderInheritance />

## Simulating Bundles

Bundles matched by the matchmaker can be simulated to check MEV profits. To simulate a bundle, we use the [`mev_simBundle`](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#mev_simbundle) endpoint. 

:::caution only matched bundles can be simulated

Bundle simulations can only be executed on matched bundles, which contain only signed transactions, or nested bundles which contain only signed transactions. Bundles with transactions including the `hash` parameter are considered unmatched, and will throw an error.

    ],
