Events on MEV-Share are distributed via an SSE endpoint. Searchers listen to this endpoint to receive a stream of new events, which contain data they can use in their bundles. Currently, the events refer to Ethereum transactions.

## Quickstart

Subscribe to the stream by making an HTTP GET request on the stream endpoint. The [matchmaker-ts](https://npmjs.com/@flashbots/matchmaker-ts) library implements this as an asynchronous event handler.

<TabItem value="ts" label="matchmaker-ts">

```typescript
import Matchmaker, { IPendingTransaction, IPendingBundle, StreamEvent } from '@flashbots/matchmaker-ts'

const matchmaker = Matchmaker.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)

const txHandler = matchmaker.on(StreamEvent.Transaction, (tx: IPendingTransaction) => {
    /*
    Do something with the pending tx here.
    */
})

const bundleHandler = matchmaker.on(StreamEvent.Bundle, (tx: IPendingBundle) => {
    /*
    Do something with the pending bundle here.
    */
})

// call before your program terminates:
txHandler.close()
bundleHandler.close()
```

<TabItem value="sh" label="curl">

```sh
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net
```

This will block until terminated manually (CTRL-C).

_Response:_

```sh
:ping

data: {"hash":"0xc7dc06c994400830054ab815732d91275bc1241f9be62b62b687b7882f19b8d4","logs":null,"txs":[{"to":"0x0000c335bc9d5d1af0402cad63fa7f258363d71a","functionSelector":"0x696d2073","callData":"0x696d20736861726969696969696e67"}]}

:::info Event Data

Events currently represent pending transactions, but eventually may be expanded to support other event types. For this reason we refer to this endpoint as an _event stream_, rather than a _transaction stream_.

### Event Stream Endpoints

| Network | URL |
|-|-|
| Mainnet | https://mev-share.flashbots.net |
| Goerli | https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net |

The endpoint sends an event with the message `:ping` every 15 seconds if no other messages were sent in the last 15 seconds.

## Event Scheme

Events dispatched via the SSE endpoint are JSON-encoded objects that adhere to the following scheme:

<StreamEvent />

Note that each of these properties are optional; if a field is not present, it means that the transaction sender chose not to share that information.

Now that you've started listening to transactions, you're almost ready to start searching! Read on to the next page to learn [about bundles](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles).


## Historical Data

Historical hints can be retrieved from the historical hint API supported by the event stream endpoint.
Each hint is associated with a block number and timestamp. Block number is the latest Ethereum block number at the time the hint was generated.
Timestamp is the timestamp at the time the hint was generated.

### GET /api/v1/history/info

Returns information about the available historical hint data.

#### Response

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| count | number | The number of historical hints available. |
| minBlock | number | The earliest block number for which historical hints are available. |
| maxBlock | number | The latest block number for which historical hints are available. |
| minTimestamp | number | The earliest timestamp for which historical hints are available. |
| maxTimestamp | number | The latest timestamp for which historical hints are available. |
| maxLimit | number | The maximum number of historical hints that can be requested in a single request. |


### GET /api/v1/history

#### Query Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| blockStart (optional) | number | The block number to start retrieving historical hints from. |
| blockEnd (optional) | number | The block number to end retrieving historical hints from. |
| timestampStart (optional) | number | The timestamp to start retrieving historical hints from. |
| timestampEnd (optional) | number | The timestamp to end retrieving historical hints from. |
| limit (optional) | number | The maximum number of historical hints to retrieve. Default limit is `maxLimit`. |
| offset (optional) | number | The offset to start retrieving historical hints from. |

#### Response

Returns an array of historical hints.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| block | number | The block number associated with the historical hint. |
| timestamp | number | The timestamp associated with the historical hint. |
| hint | Hint | Hint as it was sent to the live streaming endpoint in the past. |
