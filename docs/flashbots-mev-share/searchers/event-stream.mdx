Events on MEV-Share are distributed via an Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming endpoint. Searchers listen to this endpoint to receive a stream of new events, which contain data they can use in their bundles. Currently, the events refer to Ethereum transactions.

## Quickstart

Subscribe to the stream by making an HTTP GET request on the stream endpoint. The [mev-share-client-ts](https://npmjs.com/@flashbots/mev-share-client) library implements this as an asynchronous event handler.

<TabItem value="ts" label="mev-share-client-ts">

```typescript
import MevShareClient, { IPendingTransaction, IPendingBundle } from '@flashbots/mev-share-client'

const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)

const txHandler = mevShareClient.on("transaction", async (tx: IPendingTransaction) => {
    /*
    Do something with the pending tx here.
    */
})

const bundleHandler = mevShareClient.on("bundle", async (tx: IPendingBundle) => {
    /*
    Do something with the pending bundle here.
    */
})

// call before your program terminates:
txHandler.close()
bundleHandler.close()
```

```bash
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net

This will block until terminated manually (CTRL-C).

_Response:_

```bash
:ping

```

:::info Event Data

Events currently represent pending transactions, but eventually may be expanded to support other event types. For this reason we refer to this endpoint as an _event stream_, rather than a _transaction stream_.

:::

### Event Stream Endpoints

| Network | URL |
|-|-|
| Mainnet | https://mev-share.flashbots.net |
| Goerli | https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net |

The endpoint sends an event with the message `:ping` every 15 seconds if no other messages were sent in the last 15 seconds.

## Event Scheme

Events dispatched via the SSE endpoint are JSON-encoded objects that adhere to the following scheme:

<StreamEvent />

Note that each of these properties are optional; if a field is not present, it means that the transaction sender chose not to share that information. Below is an example of a transaction event received from the stream:

```json

### Understanding double-hash

`hash` field is actually a hash of the underlying bundle (transaction) hash, essentially double-hash. If you send a private transaction
via `rpc.flashbots.net` or `relay.flashbots.net` underlying hash is transaction hash. If you send bundle to `mev-share`, than you receive
underlying hash as part of the response. Below is code-snippet in golang to calculate double-hash for testing purposes
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/sha3"
)

func main() {
	underlyingHash := common.HexToHash("0xd2d662b8aa0e8d86ea75d363522c9ede42ef538ae353da564d501c044a885293")
	doubleHasher := sha3.NewLegacyKeccak256()
	doubleHasher.Write(underlyingHash.Bytes())
	dHash := doubleHasher.Sum(nil)
	matchingHash := common.BytesToHash(dHash)
	fmt.Println(matchingHash.String()) //prints 0x90b4f5664cc201c3aa112d6bb2fa414c4aee10f00994692b282c1d14a1db6e4d
}
```

Now that you've started listening to transactions, you're almost ready to start searching! Read on to the next page to learn [about bundles](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles).


## Historical Data

Historical hints can be retrieved from the historical hint API supported by the event stream endpoint.
Each hint is associated with a block number and timestamp. Block number is the latest Ethereum block number at the time the hint was generated.
Timestamp is the timestamp at the time the hint was generated.

### GET /api/v1/history/info

Returns information about the available historical hint data.

#### Response

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| count | number | The number of historical hints available. |
| minBlock | number | The earliest block number for which historical hints are available. |
| maxBlock | number | The latest block number for which historical hints are available. |
| minTimestamp | number | The earliest timestamp for which historical hints are available. |
| maxTimestamp | number | The latest timestamp for which historical hints are available. |
| maxLimit | number | The maximum number of historical hints that can be requested in a single request. |


### GET /api/v1/history

#### Query Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| blockStart (optional) | number | The block number to start retrieving historical hints from. |
| blockEnd (optional) | number | The block number to end retrieving historical hints from. |
| timestampStart (optional) | number | The timestamp to start retrieving historical hints from. |
| timestampEnd (optional) | number | The timestamp to end retrieving historical hints from. |
| limit (optional) | number | The maximum number of historical hints to retrieve. Default limit is `maxLimit`. |
| offset (optional) | number | The offset to start retrieving historical hints from. |

#### Response

Returns an array of historical hints.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| block | number | The block number associated with the historical hint. |
| timestamp | number | The timestamp associated with the historical hint. |
| hint | Hint | Hint as it was sent to the live streaming endpoint in the past. |


### Example

#### Get information about historical hint data

```bash
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history/info
```

_Response:_

```json
{
    "count": 20146,
    "minBlock": 9091377,
    "maxBlock": 9143624,
    "minTimestamp": 1685452445,
    "maxTimestamp": 1686225251,
    "maxLimit": 500
}
```

#### Get historical event data beginning at start of stream history

```bash
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history
```

#### Get historical hint data from a specific block range

```bash
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&blockEnd=9091379'
```

_Response:_

```json
[
  {
    "block": 9091377,
    "timestamp": 1685452445,
    "hint": {
      "txs": [
        {
          "to": "0x8d460b72eaf3d63830e16c22d1fc6908d0834abe",
          "callData": "0x",
          "functionSelector": "0x00000000"
        }
      ],
      "hash": "0x50df4922dd5f9adee91d44119132da85b50fe61f0c77556b039261f7828e1794",
      "logs": null,
      "gasUsed": "0x5208",
      "mevGasPrice": "0x3b9aca00"
    }
  },
  {
    "block": 9091379,
    "timestamp": 1685452489,
    "hint": {
      "txs": null,
      "hash": "0x40a85a6e37b449033924da72c0cf9dabcf2ac726b5a88f0ceff330f11bd01913",
      "logs": null,
      "gasUsed": "0xaae60",
      "mevGasPrice": "0x45a9b5b00"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Querying with Offset & Limit

Event history results are returned in chunks whose size are defined by `limit`, the maximum limit being specified in the [`/history/info` endpoint](#get-apiv1historyinfo).

```bash
# assuming the limit is 500
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&offset=500'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&offset=1000'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&offset=1500'

# or with a custom limit
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&limit=100'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&limit=100&offset=100'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&limit=100&offset=200'
curl 'https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net/api/v1/history?blockStart=9091377&limit=100&offset=300'
```
