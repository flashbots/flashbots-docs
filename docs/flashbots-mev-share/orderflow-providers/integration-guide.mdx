This guide covers the essential steps for wallet & dapp developers to send transactions to MEV-Share.

You can submit your orderflow to the Flashbots **Matchmaker** to internalize the MEV generated by your transactions.

### How to Integrate

The Flashbots Matchmaker is accessible through the [Flashbots Protect RPC](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#protect-rpc-reference).

#### Send Orderflow to Protect RPC

Route your application's `eth_sendRawTransaction` calls to the Protect RPC [`rpc.flashbots.net`](https://rpc.flashbots.net/) to connect to the matchmaker. By default, connecting to Protect will enable the matchmaker with the Stable configuration, which is set by Flashbots to give users the best possible execution.

#### Set Privacy Configuration

To specify a custom privacy configuration, options are passed as URL query params. These params currently include _hints_ and _target builders_. 

Hints specify which data fields in the user's transactions are shared with searchers on MEV-Share. The following hints are currently available:

<Hints />

Specifying target builders permits the specified builders to use your orderflow to build blocks.

:::caution

Adding other builders can make users' transactions land on-chain faster and more reliably, but note that Flashbots does not control how other builders operate and makes no guarantees about their behavior.

:::

The following builders are currently supported. By default, orderflow is only routed to the Flashbots block builder.

<TargetBuilders />

We strongly recommend experimenting to find the right hints for you and your users. We are eager to partner with your data and product teams to find the best balance.

#### Example

Connecting to RPC with this configuration would share logs and function selectors, and send transactions only to Flashbots:

```txt
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=logs&hint=function_selector&builder=flashbots
```

To learn more about configuring Flashbots Protect, see the [Flashbots Protect RPC docs](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#protect-rpc-reference).

### What are the guarantees and benefits?

The matchmaker will bundle user transactions with each valid searcher backrun and submit them to a dedicated Flashbots builder. The builder will choose the winning bundle and transfer 90% of the searcher's payment to `msg.sender` of the user's transaction.

If no valid backruns are submitted, the transaction will be treated as a regular [Protect transaction](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/rpc/quick-start) and receive all the typical benefits of Flashbots Protect.

### What are the risks?

This is a beta release of the Flashbots matchmaker. The matchmaker service may experience service interruptions and there may be API breaks during the trial phase.

By default, the matchmaker shares no transaction information with searchers other than the transaction hash. This is unlikely to result in the largest possible kickback. You can customize your request to share additional information and we will closely monitor and update the defaults where needed.

### Next steps

We are exploring a number of improvements. For instance — customizable kickback percentage & recipients (which would allow wallets or dapps to take a cut), more privacy settings & per-protocol defaults, and more expressive execution preferences (allowing searchers to submit bundles that contain more than simple backruns).

The Flashbots Matchmaker is one implementation of the MEV-share protocol. We are also actively designing standard interfaces for the protocol as a whole.
