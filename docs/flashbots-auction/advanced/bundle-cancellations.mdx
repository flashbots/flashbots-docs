title: bundle cancellations
---

Bundle cancellations are currently deployed to our mainnet staging environment: `https://relay-staging.flashbots.net`. You must send both bundles and cancellations to this endpoint for it to be successful.

This staging environment is limited to sending and cancelling bundles, and
will only simulate bundles targeting currently built and the next blocks. The bundles make it to our staging builder (`0x81babe`) and you should see the bundles landing on mainnet as you would be using the production endpoint.

### Understanding bundle cancellations

Bundles can be replaced and canceled using a unique identifier (`replacementUuid`) assigned to a bundle at the time of submission.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,
      blockNumber,
      minTimestamp,
      maxTimestamp,
      revertingTxHashes,
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
      builders,
    }
  ]
}
```

### Replacing bundles

To replace a bundle, send the new bundle via `eth_sendBundle` with the same `replacementUuid` as the bundle you want to replace.

### Canceling bundles

Canceling a bundle will prevent Flashbots builders from including it on-chain. To cancel a bundle, call the [`eth_cancelBundle`](/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_cancelbundle) endpoint, or use the `cancelBundle` function in your preferred [Flashbots library](/flashbots-auction/libraries/bundle-relay).
It is important to use the same set of builders as the original bundle submission to achieve a successful cancellation.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
      builders,
    }
  ]
}
```
