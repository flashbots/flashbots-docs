title: EIP-1559 Support
---

EIP-1559 is an upgrade to the Ethereum network that changes how you pay for transactions. It introduces a base fee that varies depending on the network demand, and a priority fee that you can set to get faster confirmation. The base fee is burned, while the priority fee goes to the miner who includes your transaction in a block. Flashbots, starting from [mev-geth v1.10.5-mev-0.3.0](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/releases/tag/v1.10.5-mev0.3.0), has integrated support for EIP-1559 transactions.

While users of the legacy transaction type don't need to make any configuration changes, they should be aware that it's now mandatory to include a `gasPrice` that is at least equal to the base fee. Coinbase transfer can still be used to incentivize faster inclusion, but it cannot be used to bypass the base fee requirement.

## Legacy Transaction example

Below is an example of signing bundles with a legacy transaction:

```js
const signedTransactions = await flashbotsProvider.signBundle([
  {
    signer: authSigner,
    transaction: {
      to: "0xf1a54b075fb71768ac31b33fd7c61ad8f9f7dd18",
      gasPrice: 10,
      gasLimit: 33000,
      chainId: 5,
      value: 0,
    },
  },
]);
```

The full amount of `gasPrice` will be consumed first to clear the base fee, and the remaining will be used as priority fee.

## EIP-1559 Transaction example

Below is an example of signing bundles with EIP-1559 transactions (note: `chainId` is a required attribute for 1559 or type2 transaction):

```js
const block = await provider.getBlock("latest");
const maxBaseFeeInFutureBlock =
  FlashbotsBundleProvider.getMaxBaseFeeInFutureBlock(block.baseFeePerGas, 1);
const priorityFee = BigNumber.from(2).pow(9);
const signedTransactions = await flashbotsProvider.signBundle([
  {
    signer: authSigner,
    transaction: {
      to: "0xf1a54b075fb71768ac31b33fd7c61ad8f9f7dd18",
      type: 2,
      maxFeePerGas: priorityFee.add(maxBaseFeeInFutureBlock),
      maxPriorityFeePerGas: priorityFee,
      gasLimit: 33000,
      chainId: 5,
      value: 0,
    },
  },
]);
```

Here the priorityFee is set to 2 Gwei, and the maxFeePerGas is set to be exactly equal to the max base fee in the next block plus the priority fee.

## FAQ

### Can a transaction specify `maxFeePerGas=0`?

No, all transactions must have maxFeePerGas greater than or equal to `block.baseFeePerGas`, or they are not eligible for inclusion in a block.

### Can a transaction specify `maxPriorityFeePerGas=0`

Absolutely, although the builder will need some incentive to include this transaction. With a Flashbots bundle, you can incentivize a builder/validator to include your transactions with `block.coinbase.transfer()` payments _OR_ via `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. You can also use both at the same time; the incentive is cumulative.

### Will reverting transactions still be discarded?

Flashbots still uses the same reverting transactions logic after EIP-1559: unless specified in `revertingTxHashes` in `eth_sendBundle`, a transaction that reverts invalidates an entire bundle and will not appear on chain.

However, with the new requirement for searchers to provide a gas price that meets the `base fee` for each transaction, successfully included bundle transactions may end up in the mempool following block re-organizations. If `gasPrice=0` is used, re-organized transactions are swiftly dropped from the gossip network, making it unlikely for them to appear in a future block unless reintroduced by another searcher. Transactions that pay at least the base fee will remain in the mempool and have a higher chance of appearing in future blocks, potentially conflicting with expectations regarding reverting transactions.

### How can I send a transaction from an account with 0 ETH, like one with a malicious `sweeper` running against it?

We have a working example of how to accomplish this in our [Sponsored Transaction Github Repository](https://github.com/flashbots/searcher-sponsored-tx/), which has been updated to work with EIP-1559.
