Flashbots supports EIP-1559 transactions as of [mev-geth v1.10.5-mev-0.3.0](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/releases/tag/v1.10.5-mev0.3.0). This support
requires no configuration changes for a searcher who is looking to use legacy transactions and functionality will remain the same before and after the fork.
Just as today. Searchers are still able to pay the miner via the a direct transfer to the coinbase, or via the gas tip in 1559 using the new EIP1559 Transaction Type.

**Note: For searchers using legacy transactions, passing `gasPrice` is equivilent to passing `maxFeePerGas` equal to `gasPrice` and including tip.**

**Note: Because the base fee is burned during transactions after the London fork, 0-gas transactions are no longer a available. Workarounds will be added here as they become available.**

Signing bundles with a legacy transaction:
```js
const signedTransactions = await flashbotsProvider.signBundle([
    {
      signer: authSigner,
      transaction: {
        to: "0xf1a54b075fb71768ac31b33fd7c61ad8f9f7dd18",
        gasPrice: 10,
        gasLimit: 33000,
        chainId: 5,
        value: 0,
      },
    },
  ]);
```
