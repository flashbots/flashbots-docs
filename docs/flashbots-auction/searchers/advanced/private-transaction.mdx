## How to send a single transaction to Flashbots

If you want to send a single transaction to Flashbots without sending it as a bundle, you can use the `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` method.

This method sends your transaction to the Flashbots builder on every block for a maximum of 25 blocks. No need to listen for the next block and re-send yourself. 

Private transactions can be cancelled with the `eth_cancelPrivateTransaction` method. Once a transaction is included in a block and received by proposers, we cannot "recall" it. However, we can stop including transactions in future blocks.

See [RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint) for JSON-RPC definitions of the methods.

These methods are currently implemented in [ethers-provider-flashbots-bundle.js](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/ethers-js-provider) and [web3-flashbots.py](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/web3py-provider).

    gasLimit: BigNumber.from(21000),
}

const res = await flashbotsProvider.sendPrivateTransaction({

    signer,
}, {
    maxBlockNumber: (await provider.getBlockNumber()) + 5, // only allow tx to be included for the next 5 blocks
});

if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionIncluded) {
    console.log("Private transaction successfully included on-chain.")
} else if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionDropped) {
    console.log("Private transaction was not included in a block and has been removed from the system.")
}
