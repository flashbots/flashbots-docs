#### Post-mortem for a relay vulnerability leading to proposers falling back to local block production

- On November 10, 2022, a vulnerability in the Flashbots relay was exploited, causing block proposers to fall back to local block production instead of MEV-Boost blocks. The issue stemmed from incorrect `timestamp` and `prev_randao` values in block builder submissions, leading to their rejection by the beacon node. The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by the [Manifold Finance team](https://twitter.com/foldfinance), and a fix was implemented and deployed by collaborating with various security and engineering teams. The incident affected approximately 350 blocks but did not result in proposers missing slots.
