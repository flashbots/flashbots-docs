title: Quick Start
---

Let's use mev-inspect to find the same arbitrage as [MEV Alpha Leak](https://twitter.com/mevalphaleak/status/1420416437575901185)

## Install

mev-inspect-py is built to run on kubernetes locally and in production

### Install dependencies

First, setup a local kubernetes deployment - we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start)

If using kind, create a new cluster with:

```sh
kind create cluster
```

Next, install the kubernetes CLI [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Then, install [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - helm is a package manager for kubernetes

Lastly, setup [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) which manages running and updating kubernetes resources locally

### Start up

Set an environment variable `RPC_URL` to an RPC for fetching blocks
Example:

```sh
export RPC_URL="http://111.111.111.111:8546"
```

:::note

mev-inspect-py currently requires and RPC with support for OpenEthereum / Erigon traces (not geth ðŸ˜”)

:::

Next, start all servcies with:

```sh
tilt up
```

Press "space" to see a browser of the services starting up

On first startup, you'll need to apply database migrations. Apply with:

```sh
./mev exec alembic upgrade head
```

### Tear down

First stop the running tilt window with `Ctrl+C`

Then run

```sh
tilt down
```

## Inspect a block

Using the [linked etherscan transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfcf4558f6432689ea57737fe63124a5ec39fd6ba6aaf198df13a825dd599bffc), we can see the block number is 12914944.

To inspect this block, run

```sh
./mev inspect 12914944
```

## Connect to Postgres

We'll connect to the Postgres database to see the data inspect found in that block

Let's start up a client container connected to the DB:

```sh
./mev db
```

When you see the prompt

```sh
mev_inspect=#
```

You're ready to query!

To make the data display nice, switch into "Expanded display" mode by running

```sh
\x
```

## Query for arbitrage data

Let's find that arbitrage by querying the `arbitrages` table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM arbitrages
WHERE
    block_number = 12914944 AND
    transaction_hash = '0xfcf4558f6432689ea57737fe63124a5ec39fd6ba6aaf198df13a825dd599bffc'
```

You should see output like this:

```txt
id                   | ff2deb13-c2c1-4ef5-a6ff-0ca813a07d6b
created_at           | 2021-09-27 15:26:58.193263
account_address      | 0x8e790A09F32389F36692bF8396Ef8CB7d7291A0C
profit_token_address | 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2
block_number         | 12914944
transaction_hash     | 0xfcf4558f6432689ea57737fe63124a5ec39fd6ba6aaf198df13a825dd599bffc
start_amount         | 70287643212620210176
end_amount           | 123848351154563483804
profit_amount        | 53560707941943273628
```

We can see this matches the original tweet description!

The `profit_token_address` is the address for WETH, our `start_amount` is 70 WETH (assuming 18 decimals), and our `end_amount` is 123 WETH

## Query for arbitrage swaps

We can learn about the swaps involed in this arbitrage by joining against the `arbitrage_swaps` and `swaps` tables

:::note
You'll need to switch in the id you got in the first query for arbitrage_id
:::

```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM swaps s
JOIN arbitrage_swaps arb_swaps ON
    s.transaction_hash = arb_swaps.swap_transaction_hash AND
    s.trace_address = arb_swaps.swap_trace_address
WHERE arb_swaps.arbitrage_id = 'ff2deb13-c2c1-4ef5-a6ff-0ca813a07d6b';
```

You should see output like this:

```txt
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------
created_at        | 2021-09-27 15:26:58.180131

trace_address     | {0,0}

...
```

## Query for miner payment

Lastly, we can see how much was paid to the miner for this transaction by querying by the transaction hash:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM miner_payments
WHERE transaction_hash = '0xfcf4558f6432689ea57737fe63124a5ec39fd6ba6aaf198df13a825dd599bffc';
```

You should see results like this:

```txt
created_at                       | 2021-09-27 15:26:58.245444
block_number                     | 12914944
transaction_hash                 | 0xfcf4558f6432689ea57737fe63124a5ec39fd6ba6aaf198df13a825dd599bffc
transaction_index                | 1
miner_address                    | 0x5A0b54D5dc17e0AadC383d2db43B0a0D3E029c4c
coinbase_transfer                | 48204637147748941824
base_fee_per_gas                 | 0
gas_price                        | 0
gas_price_with_coinbase_transfer | 200463421638605
gas_used                         | 240466
transaction_to_address           | 0x8e790A09F32389F36692bF8396Ef8CB7d7291A0C
transaction_from_address         | 0xd80276cd0348e9b3c5d017e1f7529f0a785fec3a
```

`gas_price` is the gas price paid directly as gas (it includes the EIP-1559 base fee)

`coinbase_transfer` is the amount of ETH paid directly as a transfer to the validator's address

`gas_price_with_coinbase_transfer` is the gas price including both original gas and coinbase transfers

So in total, this searcher paid 48.2 ETH to make 53.5 ETH for a net profit of 5.3 ETh
