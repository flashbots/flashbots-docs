## Page Title & Data

For the title of the page, and the name of the tab, at the very top of your file, just add this code snippet to the top.

Any thing inbetween the `---` tags will be used for the meta data of the page

```md

For Heading 1 specifically, you should set the page title in the meta data

```

**_Italic & Bold_**

```

## Codeblocks

So you basically define a section using the ` ``` ` anything between two lines that contain these 3 back quotes will be in the block

If you want specific formatting for a certain language like for example Javascript here:

```js
const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"]
```

```md
Mind the indentation here, code blocks in code blocks isn't normal usage
    ```js
    const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"]
    ```
```

Theres a lot of different formattings to use, `md`, `js`, `ts`, etc. The package used is [Prism react render](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)

## Footnotes & references

This is how we make a reference to a foot note or reference that's found at the bottoms of the page.[^1]

```md
This is how we make a reference to a footnote [^1] that's found at the bottoms of the page
```

To create list of foot notes, you just add list like this somewhere, preferably at the bottom of the file

```md
[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual

```
