By default, when a user specifies which builders their transactions should be sent to (by setting `targetBuilders`), those settings are inherited by bundles which use those transactions.

Searchers can override these settings by specifying `targetBuilders` in the bundle's `auction` parameters.

If `targetBuilders` is specified in a bundle, then the bundle will be sent only to those builders.
