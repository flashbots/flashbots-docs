MEV-Share is an open-source protocol for users, wallets, and applications to internalize the MEV that their transactions create ("orderflow auction"). It  allows users to selectively share data about their transactions with searchers who bid to include the transactions in bundles. Users can choose how the searcher's bid is redistributed -- between themselves, validators, or other parties.

MEV-Share is credibly neutral, permissionless for searchers, and does not enshrine a single block builder. It aims to reduce the centralizing impact of exclusive orderflow on Ethereum while enabling wallets and other sources of order flow to participate in the MEV supply chain.
