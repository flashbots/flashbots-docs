title: simple arbitrage bot
---
simple-arbitrage is a repository that contains a simple, mechanical system for discovering, evaluating, rating, and submitting arbitrage opportunities to the Flashbots bundle endpoint. Please note that this is **very unlikely to be profitable, as many users have access to it, and it is targeting well-known Ethereum opportunities.**

We hope you will use the simple repository as an example of how to integrate Flashbots into your own Flashbot searcher (bot). Access the simple-arbitrage repository [here](https://github.com/flashbots/simple-arbitrage).
