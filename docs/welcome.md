Flashbots is a research and development organization working on [mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques](https://medium.com/flashbots/frontrunning-the-mev-crisis-40629a613752) and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum. Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction.

This docs website is an aggregation of all our repositories on Github and should help you navigate through what we've built and how it can be helpful to you. It is split in two main sections:
* Flashbots Core: 
* Flashbots Data:

The pm repository on the Flashbots github provides an overview of our activities, you can access it [here](https://github.com/flashbots/pm).
